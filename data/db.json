You're aware that he's been having major problems with his marriage and hasn't been happy for a while but this has never stopped him from socialising before. In fact, he was ready to get a divorce and his mood was slowly improving earlier. After repeatedly asking him to join you out for a drink one evening, he lets you know that his wife's physical health has taken a turn for the worse and he's been forced into a position to be her main caregiver. His sister is planning to move closer to him to help out, but he's torn and doesn't feel able to get a divorce anymore. His health insurance doesn't fully cover his wife's treatment and he's been trying to work overtime in an attempt to cover the costs. He's already overworked and was looking forward to some time off to be able to re-discover his passion for travelling after his divorce, but all his plans have been put on an indefinite hold. He's unable to sleep at night and spends the night drinking as it's the only way he's able to cope and get some time alone. His insomnia has been making it difficult for him to focus at work and his manager has been really hard on him for not being able to deliver tasks on time. He mentions that he has access to mental health support through his company's EAP, but you're still worried about him and his well being. One day after work you offer to drop him home and on the car ride back he tells you he doesn't think he can go on anymore - there's nothing left for him to look forward to. He doesn't see the point in living in this world anymore.",
